# TextProc
Toy REST API for basic text processing

This was made as a weekend project to learn Flask and basic NLP.

It's a Flask RESTful API with CRUD capabilities that can also do some basic text processing.

* Using SQLAlchemy and Flask-Marshmallow for DB
* Flask-RESTful for the actual REST resources
* And simple text processing functions that use NLTK.
