# TextProc
Toy REST API for basic text processing

This was made as a weekend project to learn Flask and basic NLP.

It's a Flask RESTful API with CRUD capabilities that can also do some basic text processing.

* Using SQLAlchemy and Flask-Marshmallow for DB
* Flask-RESTful for the actual REST resources
* And simple text processing functions that use NLTK.

### Init db and run api:

```
$ python
>> from app import db
>> db.create_all
```
```
$ python ./app.py
```

### Usage examples (cURL):

* Create new user:

```
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request POST   --data '{"name":"Jo√£o","content":"I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness.'   http://localhost:5000/users
```

* Get user 1's bag-of-words:

```
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request GET  http://localhost:5000/users/1/getbow
```

* Get the word most similar to 'pleasure' in user 1's vocabulary:

```
$ curl --header "Content-Type: application/json"   --request GET  http://localhost:5000/users/1/wordvec
```
